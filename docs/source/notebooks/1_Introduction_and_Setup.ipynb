    "`PyCSI` is a Python library designed to help users connect to the CSI software API. \n",
    "It provides classes that allow the user to connect, modify and retrieve data from a CSI software model through single-line functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `PyCSI` was written for Python 3.10, some functions may not work in other Python versions.\n",
    "2. `PyCSI` works with the following software:\n",
    "    * ETABS v18 or higher\n",
    "    * SAP2000 v20 or higher\n",
    "    * SAFE v20 or higher"

    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "PyCSI is a Python library. To use it, one must have an Integrated Developed Environment (IDE), such as Spyder, PyCharm or Visual Studio Code. Familiarity with Python concepts is necessary. Our [Coders Group Training Program](https://degenkolbengineers.sharepoint.com/sites/eng/SitePages/Coders%20Group/[Coders-Group]-Training-Program.aspx) provides introductory Python tutorials, which are highly recommended.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Like other Python tools at Degenkolb, PyCSI is available on GitHub and stored in Degenkolb's private account. Access the GitHub Repository at https://github.com/Degenkolb-Internal/PyCSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use PyCSI, a personal GitHub account must be registered under [Degenkolb-Internal](https://github.com/Degenkolb-Internal). Please visit the [Coders Group GitHub page](https://degenkolbengineers.sharepoint.com/sites/eng/SitePages/Coders%20Group/[Coders-Group]-GitHub.aspx) for instructions on creating an account and downloading it from a GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* PyCSI is a library under constant development. We recommend forking and cloning the repository to keep local copies synced with the latest updates easily.\n",
    "* Activate the “Watch” feature for the Degenkolb-Internal/PyCSI repository to receive email notifications when updates are available for download."
